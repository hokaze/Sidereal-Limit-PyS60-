## Sidereal Limit (PyS60) ##
# Alternative Sidereal Limit generator "Hubristic Destiny" for Symbian S60v3 devices #

Based on a forum thread likely lost in the shifting of the White Wolf forums, there was a concept for alternative limit for Sidereals in Exalted 2nd Edition.
This program was quickly written to generate them on the fly and on the go using symbian port of python.

...I was easily amused?
    
Due to such phones falling out of favour at the time of development, this was only ever tested on a dependable Nokia 6730 Classic. YMMV.
